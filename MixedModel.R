# Code to perform mixed model regression on Anion Gap data

# 1) Read in csv's
# 2) THis is still proof of concept, so data doesn't have to be super clean
# 3) Start with simple linear regression, then add layers one at a time to make 
    # that I'm doing things correctly
# 4) Once I have even a couple terms working, can probably reach out to Eldad 
    # to schedule another meeting
